# Bully Algorithm
# - Each node has an unique ID
# - Each node communicates with each other and broadcasts their ID

# If P receives a Coordinator message, it treats the sender as the coordinator

# When any process notices that the coordinator is no longer responding to requests, it initiates an election.
